# Bootstraps

## Properties

`function execute()` - Execution call

`order` - Order of execution, `0` belongs to greetings, so start with 1, if it doesn't matter, leave `undefined`

`before` - `boolean`, whether to execute before initializing controllers, routes & models, or after. 

**NOTE: Likely to be replaced with something more specific so you can inject something between models and controllers**
