# Models

Models are data models for the MVC. System's Model bootstrap assigns models to global scope.


## Structure

Structure is depending on what data provider you will use. The base adapter is ElasticSearch, so the model
follow's their standard of mappings.


## Adding functions to each model

You can iterate over each model in `global.models` and assign a function to each one of them
